The Terraform scripts create a VPC with public and private subnets, an internet gateway, and a security group for the EKS control plane.
The EKS cluster is then created, associating it with the VPC, subnets, and security group.
The GitHub Actions pipeline automates the deployment of the infrastructure using Terraform.



**Best Practices**:

Use a dedicated VPC for the EKS cluster to isolate it from other resources.
Employ security groups to control network access to the cluster.
Consider using a managed Kubernetes service provider like EKS for simplified management and security.
Implement autoscaling for worker nodes to handle varying workloads.
Regularly update Kubernetes and cluster components to address security vulnerabilities.
